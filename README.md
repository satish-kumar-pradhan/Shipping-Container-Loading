# Shipping-Container-Loading
Contruction heuristics for efficient packing of shipping container

The final volume utilisation came to be at 83.15%, competitive with other alogrithms. A stack approach with a ngoi matrix with 2 dimension apporach was used. The stack are not optimized in vertical direction. Further performance gain may take more than needed time and metaheuristics to be employed for better results.
